			<h2>Arduino Hardware and Programming: Making a clock.</h2>
			<p>
				Having been introduced to Arduinos during the first year of my Software engineering degree at Aberystwyth University I decided I really wanted to try and pursue different projects with my Arduino. Therefore after finding and purchasing a hardware package for the Arduino I decided to create my own clock using the LCD screen provided and a serial clock circuit. <strong>GitHub</strong> [<a href="https://github.com/AlexToop/arduino_clock"target="_blank">LINK</a>]

			<h2>Website Development.</h2>
			<p>
				Having been taught about websites in a first year module I decided I would like to make my own website. I could have used solutions such as WordPress to make the process easier, however I chose to write the website from scratch to get a better feel for HTML and CSS. Whilst creating the website I decided to focus on simplicity and functionality. A design concept I personally adore. <strong>GitHub</strong> [<a href="https://github.com/AlexToop/alextoop.github.io"target="_blank">LINK</a>]

			<h2>Xcode iOS Development.</h2>
			<p>
				After hearing many positive things about the Swift programming language my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to try and develop an iOS application using Xcode. Having had no prior experience with the IDE or the language the initial learning curve was quite steep. However, soon I became more familiar with the syntax and development environment. <strong>GitHub</strong> [<a href="">LINK_NA</a>]
